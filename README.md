Benchmarking Runtime vs Compile-Time Polymorphism for Different Compute Functions in C++

## üìñ Background
When discussing **compile-time vs runtime polymorphism** in C++, it‚Äôs often stated that compile-time polymorphism can be faster due to factors like function inlining, elimination of virtual table lookups, and better compiler optimizations. However, these discussions are frequently followed by a caveat:

> *Performance differences are highly use-case dependent, and profiling is required to determine the impact in a given scenario.*

As I explored this, I expected to find **benchmark results** from developers evaluating whether compile-time polymorphism would benefit their specific use cases.   However, after searching the web, GitHub, and academic literature, I realized that **hard numbers were surprisingly difficult to find**‚Äîmost discussions acknowledge potential differences, but few provide **concrete performance data**.

## üéØ What This Project Does


### ‚úÖ **Compares Runtime vs Compile-Time Polymorphism Performance**
This project benchmarks **runtime vs compile-time polymorphism** for two compute functions:

#### **Simple Computation** ‚Äì Fused Multiply-Add (FMA):
```cpp
inline double ComputeFMA(double x) { return x * 1.414 + 2.718; }
```
#### **Complex Computation** ‚Äì Sin, Log and a Square Root:
```cpp
inline double ComputeExpensive(double x) {
    return std::sin(x) * std::log(x + 1) + std::sqrt(x);
}
```
Each function is tested using:
- **Runtime polymorphism** via virtual function calls.
- **Compile-time polymorphism** using the Curiously Recurring Template Pattern (CRTP).
- **C++20 Concepts**  which enable compile-time type enforcement and selection, achieving behavior similar to polymorphism without inheritance.

### üîß Provides a Template for Benchmarking Other Compute Functions

This project is designed with modularity and ease of modification in mind, making it a useful starting point for benchmarking compile-time vs. runtime polymorphism with other compute functions. The codebase provides a structured comparison framework that can be easily adapted to test additional operations.


## ‚ö° Getting Started

### üîπ Requirements

#### ‚úÖ Basic Execution Time Comparisons

- C++ compiler compatible with C++20 standard
- git
- cmake

#### üìä Detailed Profiling (Optional)

- A Linux system with `perf` installed is required to perform the same profiling that is demonstrated in later sections.



### üèóÔ∏è Building

#### üîπ Standard Build

Clone this repository and change working directory:

```shell
https://github.com/duanegoodner/polymorphism-compare
cd polymorphism-compare
```

Create the build directory:
```shell
mkdir build
```

Then generate the build system and compile:
```shell
cmake -B build
cmake --build build
```

#### üîπCMake Configuration Options

The default compiler flags specified by `CMakeLists.txt` are `-O3 -march=native`. The following CMake confiuration options are also available.


| -D Option         | Compiler Flags |
|-------------------|---------------------------------|
| `ENABLE_DEBUG`      | `-O0 -g`                        |
| `ENABLE_NO_INLINE`  | `-O3 -march=native -fno-inline` |
| `ENABLE_LOW_OPT`    | `-O1 -march=native`             |
| `ENABLE_PROFILING`  | `-O3 -march=native -pg`         |
| `RESET_DEFAULTS`    | `-O3 -march=native`             |

#### üîπ Example: Enable Profiling
In the build command sequence, replacing this:
```shell
cmake -B build
```
with this:
```shell
cmake -B build -DENABLE_PROFILING=ON
```
will cause the compiler flags to be `-O3 -march=native -pg`.


### üèÉ Running the Benchmarks

#### üîπ Command Line Help

```shell
./build/bin/benchmark --help
```
**Output:**
```
Usage: ./build/bin/benchmark [polymorphism_category] [computation] [-n iterations] [-s]
 - No arguments: Runs all tests with the default iteration count.
 - With two arguments: Runs a specific test with the default iteration count.
 - With '-n iterations': Runs all tests with a custom iteration count.
 - With '-s': Saves execution time data.

Valid arguments:
 ------------------------
 Polymorphism Categories:
 ------------------------
  - concepts

```


#### üîπ Run All Tests

To run all possible combinations of polymorphism type and compute function, and save the execution time data, run: 
```shell
./build/bin/benchmark -s
```

**Output:**
```

```

#### üîπ Run a Single Test

To run a single test, we need to provide arguments identifying the polymorphism type and the compute function:

For example:
```
./build/bin/benchmark crtp expensive
```
**Output:**
```
Running: polymorphism_tests::TestCRTPExpensive
Iteration Count: 1000000000
Expensive Computation: CRTP Polymorphism Time = 0.391168 seconds
```

#### üîπ Custom Number of Iterations

The default number of times to run a compute function is 1e9. We can change this using the `-n` option:
```
./build/bin/benchmark runtime fma -n 500000
```
**Output:**
```
Running: polymorphism_tests::TestRuntimeFMA
Iteration Count: 500000
FMA Computation: Runtime Polymorphism Time = 0.00343413 seconds
```

## üìä Profiling with `perf`


### üîπ Build with Profiling

```shell
cmake -B build -DENABLE_PROFILING=ON
cmake --build build
```

### üîπ Run Profiling Tests

From the repo root, run:
```shell
./test/run_perf_tests.sh
```
To use a **custom number of iterations**:
```shell

```

### üîπ Viewing Profiling Data

All profiling results will be saved in:
```
./data/perf/<timestamp-based-directory-name>/
```
Example:

```
All tests completed. Results are in: ./data/perf/2025-02-27_21-37-21/
```

### üîë Key Takeaways from `perf` Tests
- CRTP and Concepts are ~4x faster than Runtime polymorphism for FMA and ~17x faster  for the Expensive computation
- No significant execution time difference between CRTP and Concepts
- Runtime polymorphism executes significantly more instructions than CRTP/Concepts
- Runtime polymorphism branch mispredictions are similar to CRTP/Concepts for FMA but nearly ~2x higher for Expensive computation.
- Runtime polymorphism is more frontend bound, especially for FMA (fetch latency issues) 
- CRTP and Concepts generally shift most execution to the backend (efficient execution unit use)
- Surprisingly, Concepts Expensive is more frontend bound than all other tests except Runtime FMA. The reason for this difference is unclear, but may be due to differences. In any case this result warrants further investigation.
