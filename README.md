*Benchmarking Runtime vs Compile-Time Polymorphism for compute functions in C++*

## ‚ö° TL;DR
- This project benchmarks Runtime Polymorphism vs. Compile-Time Polymorphism (CRTP & C++20 Concepts).
- Two compute functions are tested: one simple, one complex.
- CRTP and C++20 Concepts are significantly faster than Runtime Polymorphism, with the gap widening for more complex computations.
- For the more complex computation, Runtime Polymorphism shows: 17x longer runtime, 27x more branches, 50x more instructions, and 5 orders of magnitude more memory accesses.
- CRTP and Concepts perform nearly identically.



## üìñ Background
When discussing *runtime vs compile-time polymorphism* in C++, it‚Äôs often stated that compile-time polymorphism can be faster due to factors like function inlining, elimination of virtual table lookups, and better compiler optimizations. However, these discussions are frequently followed by a caveat:

> *Performance differences are highly use-case dependent, and profiling is required to determine the impact in a given scenario.*

As I explored this, I expected to find many benchmark results from developers evaluating whether compile-time polymorphism would benefit their specific use cases.   However, after searching the web, GitHub, and academic literature, I realized that *hard numbers were surprisingly difficult to find* ‚Äî most discussions acknowledge potential differences, but few provide *concrete performance data*.

## üéØ What This Project Does


### üîπ Compares Runtime vs Compile-Time Polymorphism Performance
This project benchmarks runtime vs compile-time polymorphism for two compute functions:

#### Simple Computation ‚Äì Fused Multiply-Add (FMA):
```cpp
inline double ComputeFMA(double x) { return x * 1.414 + 2.718; }
```
#### Complex Computation ‚Äì Sin, Log and a Square Root:
```cpp
inline double ComputeExpensive(double x) {
    return std::sin(x) * std::log(x + 1) + std::sqrt(x);
}
```
Each function is tested using:
- **Runtime polymorphism** via virtual function calls.
- **Compile-time polymorphism** using the Curiously Recurring Template Pattern (CRTP).
- **C++20 Concepts**  which enable compile-time type enforcement and selection, achieving behavior similar to polymorphism without inheritance.

### üîπ Provides a Template for Benchmarking Other Compute Functions

This project is designed with modularity and ease of modification in mind, making it a useful starting point for benchmarking compile-time vs. runtime polymorphism with other compute functions. The codebase provides a structured comparison framework that can be easily adapted to test additional operations.


## üöÄ Getting Started

### üîπ Requirements

#### For Basic Execution Time Comparisons

- C++ compiler compatible with C++20 standard
- git
- cmake

#### For Detailed Profiling (Optional)

- A Linux system with `perf` installed is required to perform the same profiling that is demonstrated in later sections.



### üîπ Building

#### üîπ Standard Build

Clone this repository and change working directory:

```shell
https://github.com/duanegoodner/polymorphism-compare
cd polymorphism-compare
```

Create the build directory:
```shell
mkdir build
```

Then generate the build system and compile:
```shell
cmake -B build
cmake --build build
```

#### üîπCMake Configuration Options

The default compiler flags specified by `CMakeLists.txt` are `-O3 -march=native`. The following CMake confiuration options are also available.


| -D Option         | Compiler Flags |
|-------------------|-----------------------|
| `ENABLE_DEBUG`      | `-O0 -g`            |          |
| `ENABLE_NO_INLINE`  | `-fno-inline`       |
| `ENABLE_LOW_OPT`    | `-O1`               |
| `ENABLE_PROFILING`  | `-pg`               |
| `RESET_DEFAULTS`    | `-O3 -march=native` |

#### üîπ Example: Enable Profiling
In the build command sequence, replacing this:
```shell
cmake -B build
```
with this:
```shell
cmake -B build -DENABLE_PROFILING=ON
```
will cause the compiler flags to be `-O3 -march=native -pg`.

## üß™ Testing Core Functionality

Before running benchmarks and profiling, we can verify the functionality of all core components using automated tests built with [GoogleTest](https://github.com/google/googletest). The test source code is located in `./test/core/`.  

To run all tests, use the provided script:

```bash
./test/core/run_tests.sh
```

## üèÉ Running the Benchmarks (without profiling)

The `benchmark` executable can be run directly from the command line.

### üîπ Command Line Help

```shell
./build/bin/benchmark --help
```
**Output:**
```
Usage: ./build/bin/benchmark [polymorphism_category] [computation] [-n iterations] [-s]
 - No arguments: Runs all tests with the default iteration count.
 - With two arguments: Runs a specific test with the default iteration count.
 - With '-n iterations': Runs all tests with a custom iteration count.
 - With '-s': Saves execution time data.

Valid arguments:
 ------------------------
 Polymorphism Categories:
 ------------------------

```
### üîπ Run a Single Test
To run a single test, we need to provide arguments identifying the polymorphism type and the compute function. For example:

```shell
./build/bin/benchmark crtp expensive
```

**Output:**
```shell
Running: polymorphism_tests::TestCRTPExpensive
Iteration Count: 1000000000
Expensive Computation: CRTP Polymorphism Time = 0.391168 seconds
````

### üîπ Custom Number of Iterations

```shell
./build/bin/benchmark runtime fma -n 500000
```
**Output:**
```shell
Running: polymorphism_tests::TestRuntimeFMA
Iteration Count: 500000
FMA Computation: Runtime Polymorphism Time = 0.00343413 seconds
```

## üîé Profiling with `perf`

We can use the Linux tool `perf` to gain more insight into differences among various forms of polymorphism and compute functions.

### üîπ Build with Profiling

In order to use perf, we need to build with profiling enabled.

```shell
cmake -B build -DENABLE_PROFILING=ON
cmake --build build
```

### üîπ Automated Test Module

Python module `./test/profiling/perf_tests.py` can be used to run the benchmarks and save results as both raw `.txt` files and as cleaned `.feather` files that can be easily read into a Pandas DataFrame.

***For command line help, run:**

```shell
python test/profiling/perf_tests.py --help
```
**Output:**
```
usage: perf_tests.py [-h] [-p POLYMORPHISM_TYPES [POLYMORPHISM_TYPES ...]]
                     [-c COMPUTE_FUNCTIONS [COMPUTE_FUNCTIONS ...]] [-r RUNS_PER_CONDITION]
                     [-i ITERATIONS_PER_RUN]

Runs perf tests for various combinations of polymorphism types and compute functions. Saves raw (.txt) and
cleaned (.feather) data to a timestamped directory under ./data/perf.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -p POLYMORPHISM_TYPES [POLYMORPHISM_TYPES ...], --polymorphism_types POLYMORPHISM_TYPES [POLYMORPHISM_TYPES ...]
                        List of polymorphism types to test (default: crtp concepts runtime)
  -c COMPUTE_FUNCTIONS [COMPUTE_FUNCTIONS ...], --compute_functions COMPUTE_FUNCTIONS [COMPUTE_FUNCTIONS ...]
                        List of compute functions to test (default: fma expensive)
  -r RUNS_PER_CONDITION, --runs_per_condition RUNS_PER_CONDITION
                        Number of runs per test condition (default: 5)
  -i ITERATIONS_PER_RUN, --iterations_per_run ITERATIONS_PER_RUN
                        Number of iterations per run (default: 1000000000)

```


### üîπ Example: Profiling a Single Test Condition

```
python test/profiling/perf_tests.py -p concepts -c fma
```
**Output:**
```
------------------------------------------------
Running perf for: Polymorphism Type = concepts
Compute Function = fma
Number of Runs = 5
Number of Iterations per Run = 1000000000
Results saved to: /home/duane/dproj/polymorphism-compare/data/perf/2025-03-17_09-03-37/1_concepts_fma.txt
Re-running to collect perf summary...
Results saved to: /home/duane/dproj/polymorphism-compare/data/perf/2025-03-17_09-03-37/1_concepts_fma_summary.txt
Building Dataframe from detailed perf output
DataFrame saved to /home/duane/dproj/polymorphism-compare/data/perf/2025-03-17_09-03-37/perf_detailed_runs.feather
Building Dataframe from summary perf output
DataFrame saved to /home/duane/dproj/polymorphism-compare/data/perf/2025-03-17_09-03-37/perf_summary_runs.feather
```

Note that there are two sets of runs for each condition: one for detailed perf output and one for summary perf output (perf does not support collecting summary info and custom events in the same run).

### üîπ Customizing Number of Iterations

The default setting is to run 5 tests per condition and 1e+9 iterations per test. We can customize these values with the `-r` and `-i` flags, respectively:
```
python test/profiling/perf_tests.py -p crtp -c expensive -n 10 -i 50000000
```
**Output:**
```
------------------------------------------------
Running perf for: Polymorphism Type = crtp
Compute Function = expensive
Number of Runs = 10
Number of Iterations per Run = 50000000
[...]
```


### üîπ Run All Tests

To run all possible combinations of polymorphism type and compute function, we can run the script without passing any arguments for `-p` or `-c`: 
```shell
python test/profiling/perf_tests.py
```

### üîπ Viewing Profiling Data

All profiling results will be saved in:
```
./data/perf/<timestamp-based-directory-name>/
```

Each timestamped output directory will include raw .txt data produced by `perf` as well as cleaned data in two `.feather` files: `perf_detailed_runs.feather` and `perf_summary_runs.feather`. THe former is generally more useful. Each of these can be imported into Python as a Pandas Dataframe. 

### üìä Results

This section contains `perf` data pulled from the `perf_detailed_runs.feather` file of a series of tests that ran all possible combinations of polymorphism types and compute functions.

### üîë Key Insights

#### üèé 1Ô∏è‚É£ CRTP and Concepts are significantly faster than Runtime Polymorphism
- RP requires more instructions & branches and massively higher memory access than CRTP/Concepts.
- Virtual function calls likely account for the large gap, with a much more pronounced slowdown in the Expensive function.
- The heap-to-stack usage ratio is likely higher for RP which would contribute to its higher memory access needs. 
- Uops : Instruction ratios clearly indicate more aggressive compiler optimization for CRTP/Concepts than RP. 


#### ‚öñÔ∏è 2Ô∏è‚É£ CRTP and Concepts are identical
- CRTP and Concepts retire the same number of instructions & branches.
- Aggressive compiler optimizations likely explain why the Expensive computation is not heavier than FMA.


### Further Investigation
