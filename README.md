*Benchmarking Runtime vs Compile-Time Polymorphism for compute functions in C++*

## ‚ö° TL;DR
- This project benchmarks Runtime Polymorphism vs. Compile-Time Polymorphism (CRTP & C++20 Concepts).
- Two compute functions are tested: one simple, one complex.
- CRTP and C++20 Concepts are significantly faster than Runtime Polymorphism, with the gap widening for more complex computations.
- CRTP and Concepts perform nearly identically, except Concepts show slightly higher frontend stalls and a minor (~2.5%) slowdown for the complex function.


## üìñ Background
When discussing *runtime vs compile-time polymorphism* in C++, it‚Äôs often stated that compile-time polymorphism can be faster due to factors like function inlining, elimination of virtual table lookups, and better compiler optimizations. However, these discussions are frequently followed by a caveat:

> *Performance differences are highly use-case dependent, and profiling is required to determine the impact in a given scenario.*

As I explored this, I expected to find many benchmark results from developers evaluating whether compile-time polymorphism would benefit their specific use cases.   However, after searching the web, GitHub, and academic literature, I realized that *hard numbers were surprisingly difficult to find* ‚Äî most discussions acknowledge potential differences, but few provide *concrete performance data*.

## üéØ What This Project Does


### üîπ Compares Runtime vs Compile-Time Polymorphism Performance
This project benchmarks runtime vs compile-time polymorphism for two compute functions:

#### Simple Computation ‚Äì Fused Multiply-Add (FMA):
```cpp
inline double ComputeFMA(double x) { return x * 1.414 + 2.718; }
```
#### Complex Computation ‚Äì Sin, Log and a Square Root:
```cpp
inline double ComputeExpensive(double x) {
    return std::sin(x) * std::log(x + 1) + std::sqrt(x);
}
```
Each function is tested using:
- **Runtime polymorphism** via virtual function calls.
- **Compile-time polymorphism** using the Curiously Recurring Template Pattern (CRTP).
- **C++20 Concepts**  which enable compile-time type enforcement and selection, achieving behavior similar to polymorphism without inheritance.

### üîπ Provides a Template for Benchmarking Other Compute Functions

This project is designed with modularity and ease of modification in mind, making it a useful starting point for benchmarking compile-time vs. runtime polymorphism with other compute functions. The codebase provides a structured comparison framework that can be easily adapted to test additional operations.


## üöÄ Getting Started

### üîπ Requirements

#### For Basic Execution Time Comparisons

- C++ compiler compatible with C++20 standard
- git
- cmake

#### For Detailed Profiling (Optional)

- A Linux system with `perf` installed is required to perform the same profiling that is demonstrated in later sections.



### üîπ Building

#### üîπ Standard Build

Clone this repository and change working directory:

```shell
https://github.com/duanegoodner/polymorphism-compare
cd polymorphism-compare
```

Create the build directory:
```shell
mkdir build
```

Then generate the build system and compile:
```shell
cmake -B build
cmake --build build
```

#### üîπCMake Configuration Options

The default compiler flags specified by `CMakeLists.txt` are `-O3 -march=native`. The following CMake confiuration options are also available.


| -D Option         | Compiler Flags |
|-------------------|-----------------------|
| `ENABLE_DEBUG`      | `-O0 -g`            |          |
| `ENABLE_NO_INLINE`  | `-fno-inline`       |
| `ENABLE_LOW_OPT`    | `-O1`               |
| `ENABLE_PROFILING`  | `-pg`               |
| `RESET_DEFAULTS`    | `-O3 -march=native` |

#### üîπ Example: Enable Profiling
In the build command sequence, replacing this:
```shell
cmake -B build
```
with this:
```shell
cmake -B build -DENABLE_PROFILING=ON
```
will cause the compiler flags to be `-O3 -march=native -pg`.


### üèÉ Running the Benchmarks

#### üîπ Command Line Help

```shell
./build/bin/benchmark --help
```
**Output:**
```

#### üîπ Run a Single Test

To run a single test, we need to provide arguments identifying the polymorphism type and the compute function:

For example:
```
./build/bin/benchmark crtp expensive
```
**Output:**
```
Running: polymorphism_tests::TestCRTPExpensive
Iteration Count: 1000000000
Expensive Computation: CRTP Polymorphism Time = 0.391168 seconds
```

#### üîπ Custom Number of Iterations

The default number of times to run a compute function is 1e9. We can change this using the `-n` option:
```
./build/bin/benchmark runtime fma -n 500000
```
**Output:**
```
Running: polymorphism_tests::TestRuntimeFMA
Iteration Count: 500000
FMA Computation: Runtime Polymorphism Time = 0.00343413 seconds
```

| Polymorphism Type | Compute Function | Instructions Retired (x10<sup>9</sup>) | Branches (x10<sup>9</sup>) |
|-------------------|-----------------|--------------------------|--------------|
| Runtime          | FMA             | 13.01                    | 3.00         |

#### ‚úÖ Observations:
- **CRTP & Concepts execute the same number of instructions** across both compute functions, suggesting aggressive compiler optimizations for Expensive.

#### üî¨ Top-Down Performance Breakdown

| Polymorphism Type | Compute Function | Retiring (%) | Frontend Bound (%) | Backend Bound (%) |
|-------------------|-----------------|--------------|--------------------|-------------------|
| Runtime          | FMA             | 29.0         | 50.9               | 20.1              |
| Runtime          | Expensive       | 78.3         | 21.6               | 0.2               |
| CRTP             | FMA             | 25.1         | 2.1                | 72.8              |
| CRTP             | Expensive       | 25.1         | 1.2                | 73.7              |
| Concepts         | FMA             | 25.0         | 1.9                | 73.0              |
| Concepts         | Expensive       | 24.6         | 31.6               | 43.8              |

#### ‚úÖ Observations:
- Runtime Polymorphism (RP) is less likely to stall, but this does not compensate for its higher instruction count.
- When RP instructions do stall, they are usually frontend bound (fetch latency issues).
- CRTP & Concepts are highly backend bound (~70%), meaning execution stalls are mostly due to data dependencies.
- Concepts Expensive shows increased frontend stalls (~31%), unlike CRTP Expensive.

### üîë Key Insights

#### üèé 1Ô∏è‚É£ CRTP and Concepts are significantly faster than Runtime Polymorphism
- RP requires far more instructions and branches than CRTP/Concepts.
- Virtual function calls likely account for the large gap, with a much more pronounced slowdown in the Expensive function.
- RP instructions retire at a higher rate, but this does not compensate for the sheer number of extra instructions.
- When RP stalls, it's typically frontend bound, likely due to instruction fetch latency.

#### ‚öñÔ∏è 2Ô∏è‚É£ CRTP and Concepts are *almost* identical
- CRTP and Concepts retire the same number of instructions & branches.
- Aggressive compiler optimizations likely explain why the Expensive computation is not heavier than FMA.
- Both are backend bound (~70%), meaning execution unit stalls dominate.
- Concepts Expensive is the only outlier, showing a higher frontend bound percentage (~31%) and a small but measurable slowdown.
